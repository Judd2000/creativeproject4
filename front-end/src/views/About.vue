      Here at Operation Opportunity, we have noticed a real need from the
      students today for guidance when it comes to furthering their education.
      It's important to be ready and confident for these big steps in life.
      Taking good prep classes in high school, learning crucial study and note
      taking skills, and not being afraid of the application and admittance
      processes reduce stress and make students more successful All students
      deserve a fair opportunity to higher education. That's what we are
      committed to!
